# learn_dsa

This repository contains implementations of various data structures and algorithms in both Python and C. The goal of this project is to provide a learning resource for understanding fundamental concepts in data structures and algorithms.

## Directory Structure

### `python_implementation`

This directory contains Python implementations of the following:

- Linked List: A singly linked list implementation with operations such as add, search, insert, and remove.
- Linear Search: A simple search algorithm that iterates through a list to find a target value.
- Recursive Binary Search: A binary search algorithm implemented recursively to find a target in a sorted list.
- John's Linear Strategy: A sequential search strategy to find a target number within a specified range.
- Britney's Binary Strategy: A binary search strategy to find a target number within a specified range.
- Array Operations: Demonstrates basic operations on arrays, such as accessing, searching, and inserting elements.

### `c_implementation`

This directory contains C implementations of the same algorithms and data structures:

- Linked List: A singly linked list implemented in C with similar operations as the Python version.
- Linear Search: A C implementation of the linear search algorithm.
- Recursive Binary Search: A recursive binary search algorithm implemented in C.
- John's Linear Strategy: A sequential search strategy implemented in C.
- Britney's Binary Strategy: A binary search strategy implemented in C.
- Array Operations: Demonstrates basic array operations in C.

## How to Use

### Python Implementations

1. Navigate to the `python_implementation` directory.
2. Run the desired Python file using the command:
   ```bash
   python <filename>.py
   ```
3. Follow the prompts or review the output for the specific algorithm or data structure.

### C Implementations

1. Navigate to the `c_implementation` directory.
2. Compile the desired C file using a C compiler, for example:
   ```bash
   gcc -o <output_name> <filename>.c
   ```
3. Run the compiled program:
   ```bash
   ./<output_name>
   ```
4. Follow the prompts or review the output for the specific algorithm or data structure.
